  - Open files of a particular user in nomodifiable buffers
  - Open files of a gist with a browser (require '[tyru/open-browser.vim](https://github.com/tyru/open-browser.vim)')
3. Posting gists
  - Create a new gist from a current buffer
  - Create a new gist from all opened+listed+visible buffers
4. Editing gists
  - A file content of a gist
  - A description of a gist
  - Rename a file of a gist
